# Introduction:
Checkpost provides an security to an area or a place by authenticate the vehicles and people who enters and departure's from a particular place and time. My application runs and collects the data which type of vehicles are entries and lefts the checkpost by recording the registration number of the vehicle. It also generates the payable amount of particular type of vehicle and shows all the entries in the details menu, and the details menu has how many numbers of vehicles are passes through the checkpost and total amount to be collected on the particular day.
# Features:
1. Get User's choice of input and present the chosen Sensor's basic Datasheet.

2. Simple Project -Learning tool and easy to understand.

# 4W'S and 1H:
## What?
* It is an display based project which Guides users on some basic information regarding Sensors.
## WHY?
* Its a Good habit for young Instrumenteers to know about about the Sensors which plays as a key ingredient in their Education survival.
## WHERE?
* We can use it as a Learning platform for schools, colleges, Instrumentation Labs.
## WHO?
*  It is an automated Guide no need of any manual involvement for any mentor for users.
## HOW?
* A sensor which is the main part of this project and it is the one which detects and displays the value.
